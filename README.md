First never ever broke your head before the exam with many people write-up about exam (this can really be stressful because as a human every one love talking about himself and specially acting like superhero when he succeed)

And these are my advices


1.	If you’re a noob like me, take the course and the LABs with INE

2.	Also, if you are not in a hurry try done the “offensive learning path” with TryHackMe

3.	Prepare to the battle with chocolates and snacks like a war for few days

4.	Prepare your CheatSheet, and you can use my own (I recommended you even if you don’t want to take the exam. It’s a work of 2year)

5.	The first Target you should exploited it will already be mentioned in the letter of engagement

6.	Do not overthinking about exploit (there is not a lot) and if you didn’t get a meterpreter session so try to reset the LAB and initiate again your DB MSF or use MSF5 (From my side I used MSF5)

7.	meterpreter is solution for pivoting in this exam (Other pivoting technique like chisel etc.. it will be a waste of time)

8.	Be careful MSF6 don’t support anymore socks4a its support “socks_proxy” as exploit

9.	Good enumeration for every target because he will have the key  to others and proxychains is important

10.	Make your life easy in exploitation sometime it work for others

11.	Do not take the exam without  done some buffer over flow test and specially I have done this two lab (take care about them):

    *https://www.cybrary.it/course/offensive-penetration-testing/  « Module 6 »*


12.	Reset is not the key for buffer over flow (be smart what can reset do if your target is already up?!), and just try different ports on your listener side and try to synthetize your exploit code

13.	For the last target don’t think a lot for the escalation , the solution will show up in the first moment you got access to the machine (just think about it)

14.	Reporting is very important  I based on my own report on these (prepare your report strategy before you take the exam)

15.	Very important the exam not only to exploit/escalate Targets no (or catch the flag), take care to use Windows/Linux Enumeration technique or maybe some automated tools to gets all the possible vulnerabilities on the targets.

16.	Last things eLearnSecurity also available on discord, install the application and have fun to chatting with all the hackers community students will be there (Tryhackme , OSCP , eLearnSecurity)
